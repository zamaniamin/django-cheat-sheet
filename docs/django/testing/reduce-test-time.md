Below is an overview of common factors that might be contributing to slower test runs and some approaches you can
consider to reduce the overall execution time of your Django test suite.

### Potential Reasons for Slow Tests

1. **Database Setup:**  
   By default, Django creates a test database and applies all migrations. If your project has a lot of migrations or if
   the database operations are heavy, this step can take a noticeable amount of time.

2. **Password Hashing:**  
   Django’s default password hasher (PBKDF2) is intentionally slow for security reasons. Running tests that create users
   and authenticate them can be slowed down if the default hasher is used.

3. **Test Fixtures and Factories:**  
   If your tests rely on large fixtures or complex factories, the time to set up test data may add up.

4. **I/O and External Calls:**  
   Tests that make real-world API calls, access external resources, or load many static or media files can add overhead.

5. **Lack of Parallelism:**  
   Running tests sequentially means that even tests that could run concurrently are not taking advantage of multiple CPU
   cores.

### Recommendations to Reduce Test Time

**1. Switch to a Faster Password Hasher in Tests:**  
Replace the default hasher with a simpler one (e.g. `MD5PasswordHasher`) during testing. You can do this by adding a
conditional setting. For example:

```python
# settings.py

import sys

if 'test' in sys.argv:
    PASSWORD_HASHERS = [
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher',
    ]
```

This change will make password checks significantly faster during your tests without compromising real-world security.

**2. Use an In-Memory or Faster Test Database:**  
Consider using SQLite’s in-memory database for tests if your project allows it. You can set this up in a separate
test settings file or conditionally in the main settings:

```python
# settings.py

if 'test' in sys.argv:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    }
```

An in-memory database can speed up database operations, especially for projects with a smaller dataset.

**3. Disable Migrations During Testing:**  
Eliminating migration overhead can also speed up your tests. One popular method is to use a custom test runner or a
small snippet in your settings to bypass migrations:

```python
# settings.py

if 'test' in sys.argv:
    class DisableMigrations:
        def __contains__(self, item):
            return True

        def __getitem__(self, item):
            return None


    MIGRATION_MODULES = DisableMigrations()
```

This approach bypasses the migrations by telling Django that there are no migration files to apply.

**4. Optimize Test Data Setup:**
- **Use Factories Over Fixtures:** Factories (like those provided by Factory Boy) can create test data on demand and
often avoid loading unnecessary data that fixtures might include.
- **Reduce Data Volume:** Review whether all setup data are necessary for each test. Sometimes tests can be written
to only set up what is strictly required.

**5. Parallel Test Execution:**  
Django supports running tests in parallel by using the `--parallel` flag. For example:

```shell
py manage.py test --parallel
```

This tells Django to run tests concurrently, which can drastically cut down total test execution time on multi-core
machines.

**6. Profile Your Tests:**  
If the above tips do not give the desired improvement, consider using profiling tools to see where the time is spent.
Django’s test output or third-party packages can help pinpoint the slow parts of your test suite.

### Final Thoughts

Improving test speed is often a matter of balancing between testing fidelity and performance overhead. By switching to a
faster password hasher, using an in-memory database, disabling migrations, optimizing your test data setup, and taking
advantage of parallel test execution, you should see noticeable improvements.
